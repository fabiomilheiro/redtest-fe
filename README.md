Frontend project for [Redtest repository](https://github.com/fabiomilheiro/redtest).

# Run the app

> npm install

> npm start

# Test
Here I implemented two test suites. One for the percentage component where I verify its individual behaviour and another for the App which asserts that the components work well together (fill data, submit, retrieve and populate the table).

To run the tests, use:

> npm test

# Docs
There are some components documented. In order to have a look at what they do and how they're used, use:

> npm run styleguide
